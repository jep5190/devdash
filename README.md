## Welcome to Development Dashboard

Currently, this project is labeled as a **fun** project, its main purpose is to learn different technologies...... 

However, the vision is to create a dashboard primarily for developers and configuration managers to view information of its environments. Currently, to gather environment information, a developer or a configuration manager needs access multiple systems, such as:
- Continuous Integration Dashboard (Builds and Deployments)
- Cloud Dashboard (view instances state i.e. EC2 state)
- Repository Dashboard (view repository/branch state)
- others...

In most cases, not all developers have access to the dashboards, in addition, there is no way to associate/label/tag systems, builds, repositories across all the disconected dashboards. This dashboard will allow users to see the association between branches, configuration builds, and its associated deployed instances.

## Resources for GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ynauls/devdash/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
